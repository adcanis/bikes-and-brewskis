# bikes-and-brewskis

One of my first projects for a local client since beginning this journey. This is my first "complete" project since 2009 with Digital Vice Networks

This project was designed to be simple and to the point. While still offering the owner the ability to expand on the information provided easily and quickly. 

This project features 95% of its design thanks to Bootstrap, which allows for relativly easy updates as the owner provides them. It also sports a single page design, for precise navigation to the important imformation. 
This project remains "complete" as the owner is a new business and in the midst of building an event list and a means to handle form submissions.
